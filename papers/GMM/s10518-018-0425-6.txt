Abstract
A bespoke ground-motion model has been developed for the prediction of response spectral accelerations, peak ground velocity and significant duration due to induced earthquakes
in the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands. For applications to the calculation of risk to
the exposed building stock, extensions to the model are required. The use of the geometric
mean horizontal component in the ground-motion predictions and the arbitrary horizontal
component for the building fragility functions requires the addition of component-to-component variability. A model for this variability has been developed that both reflects the
strong horizontal polarisation of motions observed in many Groningen records obtained
at short distances and the fact that the strong polarisation is unlikely to persist at larger
magnitudes. The other extension of the model is the spatial correlation of ground motions
for the calculation of aggregated risk, which can be approximated through simple rules for
sampling the variance within site response zones. Making use of ground-motion recordings
from several networks in the field and the results of finite difference waveform simulations,
a Groningen-specific spatial correlation model has been developed. The new model also
combines results from traditional variogram fitting approaches with a new method to infer
spatial correlation lengths from observed variance reduction. The development of the new
spatial correlation model relaxes the need to approximate spatial correlation through the
sampling of site response, although the results obtained herein suggest that similar results
could be obtained using either approach. The preliminary consideration of the numerical
waveform modelling results in this study paves the way for significant extensions to be
made for the modelling of spatial correlations and the decomposition of apparent spatial
variability into systematic and random components within a fully non-ergodic framework .

1 Introduction
Gas production in the Groningen field in the northern Netherlands is inducing earthquakes,
the largest of which occurred in August 2012 near the village of Huizinge with a magnitude of ­ML 3.6. A key element in quantifying the consequent hazard and risk due to these
induced earthquakes is a model for the estimation of the ground shaking at the surface (van
Elk et al. 2017). The earthquakes initiate inside the gas-bearing Rotliegend sandstone layer
encountered at a depth of about 3 km and the radiated energy then propagates through the
overlying high-velocity Zechstein salt layer, which causes reflections and refractions of the
waves (Kraaijpoel and Dost 2013). Overlying the Zechstein is a chalk layer and near the
surface there are thick layers of soft soils, including clays, sands and peats, which can be
expected to respond non-linearly under stronger levels of shaking.
In view of the unique characteristics of the Groningen earthquakes and the velocity profile between the reservoir and the ground surface, there is a clear need to derive a fieldspecific ground-motion model. The initial model was based on simulations using source,
path and site parameters obtained from inversions of the Fourier amplitude spectra of
the recorded motions (Bommer et al. 2016). In the simulations, alternative values of the
Brune stress parameter were used in a logic-tree formulation in order to represent epistemic uncertainty associated with the extrapolations from the magnitude range of the data
­(ML 2.5–3.6) to the largest magnitudes consider in the hazard and risk modelling, which
extends to an upper limit of ~ 7.5 (see Bommer and van Elk 2017). In passing we note that
for magnitudes ≥ 2.5, moment and local magnitudes in the Groningen field are, on average,
equivalent (Dost et al. 2018).
Subsequent developments of the Groningen ground-motion model (GMM) focused on
incorporation of local site effects by predicting motions at a reference rock horizon (the
base of the North Sea formation, which is at about 800 m depth) and combining these with
non-linear frequency-dependent amplification factors (Bommer et al. 2017a). Using a fieldwide shear-wave velocity model from the surface to 800 m depth (Kruiver et al. 2017),
the field was divided into 160 zones each with non-linear amplification factors for spectral accelerations at 23 response periods and for peak ground velocity (Rodriguez-Marek
et al. 2017). The linear portion of the amplification factors for short oscillator periods were
found to depend on both magnitude and distance (Stafford et al. 2017). Another enhancement of the GMM development was to move from point-source to extended-rupture simulations (Bommer et al. 2017b; Edwards et al. 2018).
For generation of seismic hazard maps and uniform hazard spectra for the field, the
model as described is sufficient. However, for the calculation of potential structural damage to the exposed Groningen building stock, and consequent injuries and fatalities, additional elements of the GMM are required. For some structural types, the fragility is defined
not only as a function of spectral acceleration but also of duration (Crowley et al. 2017).
Consequently, the GMM also predicts the significant duration of shaking (Bommer et al.
2017a, b) and the model of Bradley (2011) for the correlation of residuals of spectral acceleration and duration is adopted. Since multiple building typologies can be encountered
within any of the grid squares in the risk modelling, and since several building types have
different fundamental vibration periods in the two orthogonal axes, period-to-period correlations are also required, for which the model of Baker and Jayaram (2008) was adopted.
The Groningen ground-motion database is not sufficient to allow the derivation of interintensity measure correlation models applicable across the magnitude range considered in

the hazard and risk calculations, but local data was used to confirm the applicability of the
adopted models.
In this paper, we address two other extensions to the GMM required for the risk calculations, namely the component-to-component variability and a model for the spatial correlation of ground motions. These are presented in the following sections of the paper, which
concludes with a discussion of potential refinements of both of these elements within the
framework of a transition to a fully non-ergodic model of spatially- and azimuthally-varying predictions of ground motions.

2 Ground‑motion database
A large number of recording stations have been installed in the field as part of a series of
different networks and recording campaigns in the years since the Huizinge earthquake.
The overall database utilised in the present study contains records specifically from the following networks:
• The KNMI B-network, which consists of 17 accelerographs located mainly, but not
exclusively, in the north of the field (Dost et al. 2017).
• The surface accelerographs only of the KNMI G-network, a network of ~ 80 borehole
arrays with an accelerograph at surface level and four geophones at depth intervals of
50 metres; operation of the first stations started in early 2015 (Dost et al. 2017).
• The TNO-operated household network, consisting of more than 350 accelerographs
installed since 2014 within buildings, mainly private residences and a few public buildings. There are concerns that the records obtained from accelerographs of this network
that are installed above ground level are contaminated with structural response. Therefore, only records from accelerographs located in basements and crawl spaces below
the ground floor are being used until the ongoing investigation of this matter is completed. The accelerographs were installed with a triggering level of 0.1 cm/s PGV,
which censored the datasets from earthquakes prior to 2016, when a system to bypass
the threshold in case of an earthquake was introduced.
• The NAM flexible network, a total of 450 geophones, used for passive monitoring
since the beginning of 2017, and re-installed at a different location in the field every
2 months, remaining operational for 45 days each time. The flexible network was operational during the latest two earthquakes of ­ML ≥ 2.5 that occurred in May 2017 and
January 2018 (Fig. 1). The geophones of the flexible network have a sampling rate of
250 Hz, identical to the accelerographs of the household network and higher than the
accelerographs of the KNMI networks, whose sampling rate is 200 Hz. Their lowest
usable frequency was found during signal processing to be in the range 0.5–0.9 Hz.

A fifth network is also operational in the field, consisting of the accelerographs installed
in the NAM facilities as part of their safe shutdown system. The records it has produced
have not been included in this database, as investigation of their usability for model development is still ongoing.
The locations of the epicentres, as well as the locations of the stations which generated
these records, are shown in Fig. 1, along with the 160 site amplification zones of the field
and the median V
­ S30 value in each zone.

RD system

However, the datasets used for the development of the component-to-component variability model, and for the spatial correlation model differ through the use of different subsets of the data shown in Fig. 1. The use of different datasets reflects differences in the
development history of these two models. The component-to-component model has been
developed in parallel with the ground-motion model used for risk computations in the field
to date and so has adopted the same empirical dataset (of just the B and G stations) used
for the overall hazard and risk model (Bommer et al. 2018). The more recent availability
of the Household and Flexible network records has since enabled consideration of a fieldspecific spatial correlation model and explains why the extended database is used for the
spatial correlation model.
The ground-motion database used for the derivation of the spatial correlation model
consists of 1546 records obtained during the 24 earthquakes of magnitudes (­ML) between
2.5 and 3.6 that have occurred since 2006 in the Groningen field. For the component-tocomponent model, only the records from the KNMI B-stations (151 records) and KNMI
G-stations (107 records) were used; these were obtained in 23 events since the model was
derived before the most recent earthquake included in the spatial correlation database.
Figure 2 shows the accumulation of usable records over time. The installation of extensive networks after 2014, the removal of the PGV-trigger threshold in the household
network instruments in 2016, and the deployment of the flexible network have all led to
great increases in the number of records obtained from each earthquake. Some 75% of the

magnitude-distance distribution of the dataset.

3 Component‑to‑component variability
Consistent with most modern ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) the Groningen GMM predicts the geometric mean values of the horizontal components. However, the
structural analyses performed for the derivation of the fragility functions for the exposed
building stock make use of single horizontal components of recorded accelerograms. Consequently, the ground-motion predictions need to be converted from the geometric mean to
the arbitrary horizontal component for the risk computations. The predicted median values
of these two horizontal component definitions are equivalent, but the standard deviation of
the geometric mean component needs to be increased to reflect the component-to-component variability (Baker and Cornell 2006).

as:

Within the risk model we define the logarithmic motions at a given point on the surface

(1)
with 𝜇(x, 𝐌) being the log-mean surface motion (which in Groningen is a log-mean reference motion at the base of the north sea formation, NS-B, for magnitude 𝐌, plus the
mean logarithmic site amplification for the given zone), 𝛿B being the between-event residual (independent of position), and 𝛿Wes (x), 𝛿c2c (x) and 𝛿S2S (x) corresponding to the site
and event corrected residual at NS-B, the component-to-component residual, and the site
amplification residual, all of which can depend upon position x. The variances of these

position-dependent components are 𝜙2SS , 𝜎c2c
that the site response is linear, but that this assumption does not strongly influence the
present treatment. In the present section our focus is upon the development of a model for
2
that describes the variance between the logarithmic amplitudes of the two horizontal
𝜎c2c
components, relative to the geometric mean amplitude.
Ground-motion recordings in Groningen are often seen to be strongly polarised, with
inter-component spectral ratios of as much as three or higher across the entire frequency
range (Fig. 4). Boore (2005) defined the component-to-component variance of a database
as the arithmetic mean of the squares of the component-to-component residuals of the
records of that database, as shown in Eq. (2), where N is the number of records and Y
­ ij is
the ­ith component from the ­jth record.

Consequently, values of component-to-component variability calculated from the Groningen ground-motion data are much higher than values typically presented for earthquake
ground motion (e.g., Boore 2005; Campbell and Bozorgnia 2007). However, when only

13

smaller (M < 6) earthquakes are considered and recordings are limited to short source-to-site
distances, higher component-to-component variances are also found within tectonic databases,
but the variability remains smaller than that found for Groningen (Bommer et al. 2017a). The
more extensive database for Groningen now available shows that the component-to-component variance is distance-dependent, consistent with the observation that strongly polarised
motions are generally recorded close to the earthquake epicentres. This distance- and magnitude-dependence is interpreted as indicating that the polarisation is due to the shear-wave
radiation pattern from the shallow sources of the small-magnitude earthquakes in Groningen.
At greater distances, the interaction of direct and indirect phases will diminish the polarisation. For larger earthquakes, the interaction of radiation patterns from adjacent segments of
the fault rupture would break down the polarisation in a similar manner.
A model for the component-to-component variance has been constructed to reflect the
observed distance dependence and inferred magnitude dependence. Firstly, a simple function
is fit to the variance values to capture the dependence on distance, and this model is assumed
to hold in the magnitude range of the data ­(ML 2.5–3.6). Secondly, it is assumed that at larger
magnitudes the component-to-component variance would be comparable to that from tectonic
models, for which we adopt Campbell and Bozorgnia (2007); a simple linear transition from
Groningen-specific to typical tectonic values is assumed over two magnitude units (Fig. 5).
The variance values at different periods are found to be well represented by a trilinear function with constant values below 0.1 and above 0.85 s. The model for the component-to-component variance of duration is constructed in a similar manner but converging at larger magnitudes to the values proposed by Bommer et al. (2009) for tectonic earthquakes.
The component-to-component variance in the model presented is defined by the following
equations for different periods, rupture distances and magnitudes, T, R and M:

(4)

In response to regulatory requirements in the Netherlands, the primary metric in the Groningen risk calculations is Local Personal Risk, which is specific to individual locations
(Crowley et al. 2017). For any spatially-aggregated risk metric, such as Group Risk, spatial
correlation in the ground-motion field is necessary to avoid underestimation of the risk.
The efforts to address this potential need are presented in this section, starting with a summary of how spatial correlation is currently approximated in the current risk calculations.
The remainder of the section presents the derivation of a new Groningen-specific spatial
correlation model, starting with a summary of the empirical data used and waveform simulations to model spatial correlation.

4.1 Simplified model in current risk calculations
The ground-motion model used for hazard and risk calculations in the Groningen field
combines field-specific predictions of motions at a reference velocity horizon, approximately 800 m below the ground surface at the base of the North Sea formation (the NS-B
horizon), with near surface site response effects. Within a Monte Carlo framework, reference motions are first generated for this horizon before these motions are modified to
account for local site effects using zone-specific site amplification functions for each of the
160 zones. One of the ultimate goals of the project is to develop spatial correlation models
that consistently account for correlations within the paths leading to the NS-B horizon, and
to then appropriately reflect spatial correlations within the site response.
For the current risk calculations the overall field is discretised into spatial cells that are
represented by a ‘grid point’. The typical spatial separation of these grid points is 500 m.
The site response model for the field is also discretised into 160 separate ‘zones’. These
zones were previously shown in Fig. 1 and while their geometries vary significantly, it is
possible to determine a representative spatial scale for each zone z as follows:
√
reff,z = Az ∕𝜋
(5)

That is, we compute the area, Az , of each zone and then compute a length scale corresponding to a circular area. Call this the effective zone radius reff,z . When these effective
zone radii are computed for all zones we obtained the distribution shown in Fig. 6. As can
be appreciated from the difference in the typical grid separation distance and the effective
zone radii, many zones contain multiple grid points.
The overall spatial correlation should ideally be decomposed into components that
reflect the partitioning of the overall variability shown in Eq. (1). If these correlation components existed, then the overall spatial correlation can be described by Eq. (6).

𝜌 xi , xj = SS,ij SS i SS j S2S,ij 𝜎S2Sx 𝜎i xS2S j c2c,ij c2c i c2c j
( i) ( j)

(6)

Currently, there is no way to constrain the various correlation components in Eq. 6,
but a level of spatial correlation is implied by making assumptions about the various
components.

Three different options were considered to approximately account for spatial correlation
in the existing hazard and risk model. In all cases it is assumed that we have 𝜌S2S,ij = 1 for
two points inside a given site amplification zone. This does not mean that the site response
itself is identical throughout a zone because each zone may contain multiple grid points at
which hazard calculations are made. Each grid point will therefore have a different sourceto-site distance and nonlinear site effects will hence differ from grid point to grid point.
However, the variability for grid points within the same zone is perfectly correlated. For
grid points in different zones 𝜌S2S,ij = 0. The three variants that were then considered were:
1. 𝜌SS = 1 and 𝜌c2c = 1 throughout a site amplification zone. Combined with the 𝜌S2S,ij = 1
assumption above, the overall correlation is 1.0 for all points within the same zone, and
0.0 otherwise.
2. 𝜌SS = 1 and 𝜌c2c = 1 within any given grid cell, but 𝜌SS = 0 and 𝜌c2c = 1 for other grid
points within the same site amplification zone.
3. 𝜌SS = 1 and 𝜌c2c = 0 within any given grid cell, but 𝜌SS = 0 and 𝜌c2c = 0 for other grid
points within the same site amplification zone.
The implied correlation for each of these options was compared with the predictions of
the Jayaram and Baker (2009) model as well as preliminary regressions on the Groningen
database used for the development of the V5 ground-motion model (Bommer et al. 2018).
As the component-to-component variability is magnitude and distance dependent, the
implied correlation varies with earthquake scenario. Additionally, as all variance components change with period the implied correlation is also period dependent. Figure 7 therefore shows just one example of the implied correlations for each of the three cases for one
magnitude-distance scenario. For the purposes of this comparison, site amplification zones
are conceptually thought of as being regular cells such that the distance from the centroid
shown in Fig. 7 can be related to reff,z.
From consideration of these implied correlations it was decided to utilise approach (i) of
perfect correlation within each site amplification zone as an interim measure ahead of the

13

Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering (2019) 17:4417–4439

4426

current study that explicitly develops an initial Groningen-specific model. This approach
consciously over-estimates the correlation for closely-spaced sites (over a length scale that
depends upon the size of the site zone), but then has zero correlation among sites within
adjacent zones.

While the empirical dataset compiled to date is very rich for some events, it is still too
sparse to provide insights into how correlations are partitioned among the travel path and
site response. However, as discussed by Edwards et al. (2018), a number of seismological
simulations have been performed for the field. The primary objective of these simulations
has been to constrain source and path scaling effects thus far, they can also provide insight
into the decomposition of spatial correlation. One of the unique aspects of the Groningen region is the wealth of subsurface information that has been collected over 40 years
of exploration and production. This information has allowed the development of a highquality 3D velocity model for the region which potentially enables systematic path effects
to be captured. By using elastic finite difference approaches and detailed 3D elastic models
the wave-field can be simulated from the source to a reference rock horizon (Edwards et al.
2018). Such wave fields can then be inspected to understand how the local geology influences the path effects and, in turn, the spatial correlation. This type of modelling has the
added advantage in that the wave field can be measured at any given location in the model
domain and on a spatially dense grid of receivers.
A key challenge within deterministic modelling of ground motions is the lack of control
over the source representation and accurately accounting for how the source complexity
scales with magnitude. The kinematics of the source also influence the observed spatial
correlations within the field, just as they can effect the component-to-component variability discussed earlier. For the purposes of this study the general slip characteristics, slip,
dip and rake, are defined from pre-existing fault architecture and first motions of recorded
earthquake data. However, no a priori knowledge of how the internal variability of the fault

rupture is assumed, rather a stochastic approach is used to capture variability in the amount
of slip, rise time, rupture velocity and direction (Graves and Pitarka 2016). This approach
allows us to explore a range of possible fault slip scenarios, to isolate the components of
spatial correlation that can be contributed by the systematic path and source effects.
The finite difference simulations used here make use of a detailed 3D elastic model that
is derived from well information and high-resolution 3D reflection seismic surveys and
was supplied by the field operator, Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM). To model
the wave-field that incorporates frequencies of interest (< 30 Hz) and to avoid numerical
dispersion the model is defined on a 6.25 m grid. The model dimensions are 40 km ×
35 km × 5 km. Synthetic 3-component seismograms are output on a 25 m × 25 m grid. The
synthetic receivers are located on a virtual bedrock surface just below the ground surface.
Non-linear near surface effects associated with near surface soil conditions are not considered in this part of the study. Synthetic data are recorded for 13 s following event initiation
and this enables the peak response at each location to be captured. Further details of these
simulations can be found in Edwards et al. (2018).
Multiple rupture scenarios, ranging in magnitude from M 3 to 6, are tested. Examples
of the spatial distribution of ground motions arising from these simulations are shown in
the upper row of Fig. 8 in terms of logarithmic PGA. All the scenarios make use of nonuniform finite fault surface, where the rate of slip, amount of slip, rise time and rake are
allowed to vary through a stochastic approach. Also tested are the impacts of fault aspect
ratio and stress drop. Held constant is the fault plane defined by the strike, dip and rake
of the rupture, these values are defined to the general trend that is observed in the field (a
strike of 270°, dip of 70°, and a rake of 90°).
Figure 8 also shows the ground-motion residuals for the three simulation examples
shown. In order to compute these residuals, it is first necessary to define the average attenuation of motions with distance over the simulated field. For this purpose, a trilinear (in
log–log space) geometric spreading function was fitted to each set of simulations. For the
three examples shown in Fig. 8, the corresponding distance decay is shown in Fig. 9 along
with the fitted models in each case. For the small magnitude simulations there is a pronounced change in the geometric spreading that is evident in both Figs. 8 and 9, and this
is a known local feature of the Groningen field. The distributions of residuals in the lower
row of Fig. 8 shows clear spatial clustering, and an ongoing objective of this work is to
understand the difference between systematic and random features of these spatial patterns.
To infer the spatial correlation from the residual fields shown in Fig. 8, semi-variograms
are computed using the classical method of moments according to Eq. (7) (Cressie 1993).

𝛾(h) = 2N1

Nh �
∑

h i=1

�2
𝜀W (x + h) − 𝜀W (x)

(7)

In this equation, Nh represents the number of pairs of normalized residuals, 𝜀W , that are
separated by a distance h to within a tolerance defined by a bin of width Δh = 0.25 km. The
normalized residuals are computed as 𝜀W = 𝛿W ∕𝜙, where 𝛿W is the residual computed with
respect to the fitted models in Fig. 9, and 𝜙 is the overall standard deviation of the withinevent residuals. Note that here when referring to within-event residuals, these are really
within-simulation residuals.
The simulated ground-motion fields shown in Fig. 8 represent 169,015 spatial locations,
which is far more than necessary to constrain a macro spatial correlation model. Therefore,
for the purposes of computing the semi-variograms according to Eq. (7), a random sample of 10,000 points was first taken from each simulated field. While this is a significant

separation distances and so the variance estimates are extremely well-constrained.
To develop the correlation model from the waveform simulations, 10 scenarios were

of Cressie (1985), as shown in Eq. (8), was minimised in an effort to optimise the fit of the
correlation model to high-levels of correlation (low levels of semi-variance).

The goal of having multiple simulations for each magnitude level is to reduce the uncertainty in the defined spatial correlation that would result from variability in the source kinematics. Figure 10 illustrates the variability in spatial correlation that can be attributed to
variability in rupture process while keeping the magnitude fixed for three different cases:
M3, M5 and M6. These results illustrate that there is a slight magnitude dependence and a
non-trivial contribution from fault rupture process (note that the correlation length, rather
than the fluctuations in the semi-variance is the key feature of consideration in this context). The average of the variograms across the three magnitude levels leads to an overall

semi-variance very close to the results for the M5 case. This is shown by plotting the actual
correlation models obtained from the semi-variograms in Fig. 11.
Although only the current results for PGA are shown here, further development of this
work will look to test assumptions of isotropy and magnitude-dependence, among other
things. For the current stage of development of the overall hazard model it remains necessary to rely primarily upon more conventional empirical approaches. Current efforts in this
direction are discussed in the following section.

4.3 Groningen‑specific spatial correlation model
The dataset described in Sect. 2 differs considerably from that used for the development of
the V5 ground-motion model (Bommer et al. 2018) through the edition of the recordings
from both the Flexible array and the Household network. As shown in Table 1 and Figs. 2
and 3, these additional records make a significant difference to the overall number of available records. However, the temporal and spatial distribution of these recordings also poses
challenges for the development of a generic spatial correlation model for the field.
Spatial correlation models focus upon correlations among computed within-event residuals, 𝛿W (x), where these residuals are computed with respect to some pre-existing ground
motion model, 𝜇(x, 𝐌), and an event-specific deviation from this generic model, 𝛿B (the
between event residual). This formulation is described by Eq. (11).

y(x) = 𝜇(x, 𝐌) + 𝛿B + 𝛿W (x)
(11)
In the present case, the obvious candidate for the ground-motion model is the current
V5 model developed for the Groningen field. However, this model is designed to predict
motions for a very broad magnitude range and does not target optimal performance in
the narrow magnitude range for which data exist. When the new Household and Flexible network observations are added to the database used within the derivation of the V5

model, it is expected that some bias, 𝛽 , should exist such that the event-specific prediction is really 𝜇(x, 𝐌) + 𝛽 + 𝛿B at each spatial location x . The first step in the derivation
of an empirical spatial correlation model is therefore to define this event-specific prediction and to determine the overall bias and the between-event residual (or random effect)
for each earthquake.
In the present study, it is not appropriate to simply perform a random effects regression on the total residuals as is commonly done in other studies (e.g., Jayaram and Baker
2009; Foulser-Piggott and Stafford 2011). The primary reason for this is that the highdensity spatial sampling of the Flexible network has a strong influence upon computed
random effects. This can be appreciated in Fig. 12 in which random effects for each
event are computed using the entire dataset available, just the KNMI-B and KNMI-G
stations (used for the calibration of the current ground motion model), and all data with
the exception of the Flexible network (FN in Fig. 12). Estimates of the random effects
differ from earlier events that are not recorded by the Household or Flexible networks
because these new records change the overall bias of the model in each case. What is
most evident, however, are the large differences between random effects computed for
the most recent events. For events 23 and 24 the random effects for the full dataset are
close to zero and this simply reflects the strong weight that the 809 records from the
Flexible network have on defining the overall model bias.
However, it is not simply the imbalance in the numbers of records that is problematic, the spatial distribution of the Flexible array also causes issues. When the Flexible network is excluded from the database, the mean inter-station spacing is 14.7 km
(about three times the value of rC for PGA implied by the waveform simulations). However, for the Flexible network the mean inter-station spacing for event 23 is 3.7 km and
only 0.5 km for the dense deployment that recorded event 24. Given that we expect
spatial correlation to exist in the data, the inclusion of the Flexible network records
biases both the random effects and the overall variance, as correlated motions over some

spatially-limited cell have lower variance than the overall variance of the field (Stafford
2012).
The process adopted for the development of the generic spatial correlation model for the
Groningen field is therefore based upon the following steps:
• Random effects for each event are computed by excluding the records from the Flexible
network. As the mean inter-station spacing for this subset of the data is much larger
than the correlation length implied from the waveform simulation results, as well as
from previous empirical regression analyses, the random effects should not be strongly
influenced by spatial correlation effects (Jayaram and Baker 2010; Stafford 2012).
• Use the random effects from the previous step to compute within-event residuals for all
records (both including and excluding the Flexible network).
• Investigate the impact of the Flexible network upon the computed semi-variograms,
and also constrain the final correlation model through consideration of the variance of
within-event residuals over the Flexible array.

Regarding the final step, the high spatial density of the Flexible array, as well as its
geometric layout, provides a unique opportunity to constrain spatial correlations in a new
manner. Stafford (2012), building upon the work of Vanmarke (1983), explained that the
variance of a correlated random field over some finite region, A, is lower than the overall
variance of the field. This is shown generically in Eq. (12):
(
)
𝜙2A = 𝜓 x; rc 𝜙2
(12)
where, 𝜙2A is the variance over the spatial region, 𝜙2 is the overall variance of the spatial
field, and 𝜓(x;rc ) is the variance reduction function that depends upon the nature of the
spatial correlation within the field. This variance reduction function is defined by Eq. (10),
and is equivalent to one minus the average correlation over the region in question:

Events 23 and 24 provide large numbers of observations from the Flexible array over
small spatial regions (with different areas in each). These regions are represented by the
vector of instrument locations x. The ratio of the variance of 𝛿W (x) values over these
̂ (x;rc )
regions to the overall within-event variance therefore gives an empirical estimate of 𝜓
for each event. As the correlations within the field appear well represented by an exponential model of the form shown in Eq. (10), the value of rc that best matches the computed
𝜓
̂ (x;rc ) provides an estimate of the correlation model.
For each response period empirical variograms were computed and exponential correlation models (with and without nugget effects) were fitted to the variograms. Variograms
may have nugget effects when the semi-variance for a separation distance of zero is not
equal to the theoretically expected value of zero; they manifest as an ‘intercept’ for the
variogram. Such effects are typically attributed to measurement uncertainty and could be
reflected in the present study by different ground-motion levels for co-located (or very
closely spaced) instruments. However, the nugget levels encountered are rather strong
here and it is not currently clear what the precise cause of this effect is. That said, the
dependence of the nugget strength on the dataset selected suggests that instrument effects
are contributing. Figure 13 shows the results from a selection of such computations for a
broad range of periods. Empirical and fitted variograms were obtained for different datasets

(either including all of the available data, or otherwise excluding records within the Flexible network). The variograms were either fitted using the loss function of Eq. (8) (referred
to as ‘Cressie’), or a simplified version of this expression that does not include the denominator of 𝛾k (𝜽) (referred to as ‘npairs’). The exponential models were also fit with and without consideration of a nugget effect.
Figure 13 shows that there is a significant difference between the empirical variograms
obtained with and without consideration of the Flexible network data. In particular, when
the Flexible network data is excluded the data exhibits a very strong nugget effect. Such
nugget effects are typically associated with measurement uncertainty, but in this particular
case it appears likely that at least part of this effect is reflecting differing levels of inherent
variability among the types of instruments that have been deployed throughout the field.
At this point, as can be seen from Table 1, there is too little overlap among sets of records

obtained from each instrument type to resolve this issue. However, it is certainly a matter
for further consideration.
Figure 14 summarises the correlation lengths that are implied by each combination
of dataset and fit. There is a significant spread of correlation lengths depending upon the
approach employed, and it should be noted that all results shown in Fig. 14 correspond to
cases in which a nugget effect is included. The variation is even greater when the nugget is
forced to zero (equivalent to having no nugget effect). In Fig. 14 the results obtained from
optimising the variance reduction function of Eq. (10) are shown along with the more traditional variogram fitting methods. The results for Event 23 suggest significantly greater
correlation lengths than is the case for Event 24. However, it is interesting to note that the
Flexible network for Event 23 covered approximately 50 km2 and spanned multiple site
amplification zones while Event 24 covered just 1 km2 and was contained entirely within a
single zone. The solid and dashed lines in Fig. 14 represent the Jayaram and Baker (2009)
correlation model for cases where site conditions exhibit clustering or otherwise. The variance reduction function results for the larger area are more consistent with the clustered
site condition results from Jayaram and Baker (2009), while the Event 24 results are far
more consistent with the unclustered case.
In Fig. 13 it is apparent for response periods of 0.3 and 0.5 s that the empirical variograms have not reached a stable plateau at 20 km separation distance. In the fitting process there is a trade-off between the sill, or partial sill, level and the correlation length, and
around these intermediate response periods the relatively long correlation lengths shown in
Fig. 14 are partially biased as a result of these total sill levels being too high. To generate
Fig. 13 the within-event residuals have been normalised and so there is an expectation that
the total sill should be very close to unity for large separation distances. For this dataset
this expectation is not always realised. In order to develop the initial model for use in the

Groningen field, a subset of the dataset and fitting method combinations was identified that
appeared to give the most stable and internally consistent results.
Figure 15 shows a subset of the correlation lengths previously shown in Fig. 14, but
also with a degree of filtering applied. Four combinations of data and fitting approach were
considered: (1) the entire dataset when used with Cressie’s loss function; (2) the dataset
excluding the Flexible network with Cressie’s loss function; (3) the dataset excluding the
Flexible network with the number of pairs weighting in the loss function; and (4) the Flexible network data for Event 24 using the variance reduction function. In addition, only
the correlation lengths for which the total sill from the fitted variogram was in the range
[0.85,1.15] were retained. This filtering resulted in the removal of some points just to the
right of the maxima shown in Fig. 15. The reason for favouring the variance reduction
estimates from Event 24 is that as further refinements are made to the site zonation and
site response modelling then any effects of apparent clustering that imply larger correlation
lengths are likely to reduce. Therefore, the shorter correlation lengths are likely to be more
representative as the model continues to evolve in the future.
Previously in Sect. 4.1, Fig. 7 compared the correlation functions from an earlier
advanced regression analysis that was conducted for the Groningen field (without any
of the Flexible or Household network data) and the model of Jayaram and Baker (2009)
with the implied correlation that arises from making different assumptions about the correlations among difference components of variability in Eq. (6). The new model shown
in Fig. 15 remains consistent with these previous results and suggests that the degree of
spatial correlation being approximated with the current Groningen risk model is unlikely to
change significantly following the introduction of the new model. However, the use of the
new correlation model will remove abrupt changes in correlation at the boundaries of site
amplification zones and will also predict weaker correlations of motions over any given
site zone. This effect may be offset slightly by stronger correlations across site zones, but
Fig. 7 already suggests that correlations at separation distances beyond about 3 km (that
captures the vast majority of site zones, as shown in Fig. 6) are already relatively weak.

5 Discussion and conclusions
The model developed herein and presented in Fig. 15 acts to strengthen earlier assumptions and preliminary analyses that have been made with respect to the modelling of
spatial correlations within the Groningen field. At face value, it appears that the incorporation of the new model is unlikely to lead to drastic changes in risk estimates that
account for aggregated spatial effects, such as group risk or portfolio loss. However, a
number of further areas for development and active investigation remain. In particular,
all of the empirical data that has been used to develop the model to date come from
small magnitude events (the maximum magnitude being ­ML 3.6). Correlations implied
by the numerical waveform modelling for PGA are broadly consistent with those
obtained from the empirical data. However, the numerical waveform modelling suggests that there may well be magnitude-dependence in the spatial correlation within the
Groningen field. The initial results that have been presented for PGA in Fig. 11 suggest a decreasing correlation length with increasing magnitude. However, it is unlikely
that this trend persists for larger magnitude events as we expect that variations over
greater spatial scales at the source will manifest as stronger spatial correlations at the
surface for intermediate and long response periods. These sorts of assumptions are readily tested using the numerical waveform modelling and will be investigated as part of
the ongoing development of this work. The end goal of the spatial correlation work is to
ensure robust representation of spatial fields over the entire magnitude range deemed of
importance for the Groningen field.
The other key area of development of this work is understanding the origins of the
apparent spatial correlation by making use of the numerical waveform simulations. The
residual distributions shown in Fig. 8 undoubtedly represent both random and systematic features. Ultimately, within a fully non-ergodic ground-motion modelling framework, any such systematic features will be identified and explicitly modelled as explicit
source-to-site path effects. It is rarely possible to constrain such patterns empirically,
especially at some depth below the surface. However, the Groningen field includes a
good number of borehole instruments (only the surface instruments have been used in
the present work), and a very high-resolution 3D velocity model. These data, combined
with significant computational resources, enable meaningful numerical simulations to
be obtained over a very broad frequency range and to potentially constrain the components of Eq. (6).
Thus far all of the spatial variograms have been computed as omni-directional (or
isotropic). The numerical waveform modelling suggests that the reality may be quite
different to this and that directionality in path scaling should be accommodated within
a fully non-ergodic model for the Groningen field. Systematic deviations from the average path scaling currently manifest as correlated within-event residuals and get mapped
into apparent spatial correlation. Furthermore, these systematic deviations can also be
responsible for variations in the total sill levels in the computed variograms as the separation distance changes. Under the assumption that the waveform simulation results are
sufficiently realistic to be treated as ‘data’, the extremely high spatial-resolution of these
simulations offers unique opportunities for refining the correlation models in the future.
Finally, the waveform simulations also have the potential to constrain the scaling of the component-to-component variability model presented herein. Currently it
is assumed that the high component-to-component variability within the field linearly
tapers down to typical tectonic levels over two units of magnitude. This assumption can

13

4438

Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering (2019) 17:4417–4439

also be tested in future developments using the waveform simulation results. Since the
component-to-component variability over the small magnitude range is so large, it is
important to try to understand the extent to which this high variability persists for larger
events.
